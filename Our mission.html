    <h1>Our mission</h1>
    <div class="container mission">
        <p>With all the chaos and problems that have been caused by the ongoing pandemic we have seen that a lot of businesses have suffered from the lack of proper online presence and marketing. Millions of people have lost their jobs because of it. Thus, good marketing is an essential tool for every company that wants to stay on the market.
            We are also concerned by the fact that the students nowadays have less opportunities to find a good job after graduation and even less possibilities to gain some real practical skills while studying. 
            <br>
            <p>
                Therefore, we have created our organization that helps companies save their businesses, multiply their prosperity, earn money during these difficult times, and also helps students to get some actual valuable experience, modern skills and knowledge to have higher chances at the labour market.
                
            </p><br>
            <p>
                We strongly believe that our organization is capable of helping many people who want to gain a career in the field of marketing.
